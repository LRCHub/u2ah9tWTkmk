Break out the cold beer, crank up the barbecue...
I feel like raising the roof
Been wait'nall year, don't give me no excuse
I'm here to party with you

The time has finally come
We're gonna have big fun
Sing us a summer song

No ordinary summer, no ordinary song
This time it's gonna last all winter long
No ordinary summer, no ordinary love
I swear it on the moon and the stars above...
(Hey yeah- now gimme gimme
Gimme gimme that thing you've got)
Alright, alright...

Hey, we'll go crushin', Down on the beach tonight
I feel on top of the world
We've got the music, we; ve got the party life
We've got these beautiful girls
Now the time has come, we; re gonna have big fun
Sing us a summer song

No ordinary summer, no ordinary song
This time it's gonna last all winter long
No ordinary summer, no ordinary love
I swear it on the moon and the stars above
(Hey yeah - now gimme gimme
Gimme gimme that thang you've got)
Alright, alright

So, it's summer time and it's party time
Lot of honeys in the sunshine
No ordinary summer...
So, it's summer time and it's party time
Lot of honeys in the sunshine
No ordinary summer...

No ordinary summer, no ordinary song
This time it's gonna last all winter long
No ordinary summer, no ordinary love
I swear it on the moon and the stars above...
(Hey yeah, now)
