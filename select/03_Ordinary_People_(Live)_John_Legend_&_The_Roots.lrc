[00:24.38] Girl I'm in love with you
[00:27.45] This ain't the honeymoon
[00:30.82] Past the infatuation phase
[00:43.82] 
[00:36.01] Right in the thick of love
[00:39.22] At times we get sick of love
[00:41.99] It seems like we argue every day
[00:57.99] 
[00:47.07] I know I misbehave
[00:49.65] And you made your mistakes
[00:52.34] And we both still got room left to grow
[01:11.84] 
[00:57.21] And though love sometimes hurts
[01:01.05] I still put you first
[01:03.80] And we'll make this thing work
[01:06.58] But I think we should take it slow
[01:23.58] 
[01:10.36] We're just ordinary people
[01:15.48] We don't know which way to go
[01:22.44] â€ Cause we're ordinary people
[01:26.08] Maybe we should take it slow
[01:40.08] 
[01:36.52] Take it slow
[01:41.35] This time we'll take it slow
[01:47.46] Take it slow
[01:52.41] This time we'll take it slow
[02:06.41] 
[01:54.25] This ain't a movie no
[01:56.15] No fairy tale conclusion y'all
[01:59.03] It gets more confusing every day
[02:15.03] 
[02:03.58] Sometimes it's heaven sent
[02:06.74] Then we head back to hell again
[02:09.69] We kiss then we make up on the way
[02:26.69] 
[02:12.82] I hang up you call
[02:16.44] We rise and we fall
[02:19.28] And we feel like just walking away
[02:36.28] 
[02:23.55] As our love advances
[02:26.73] We take second chances
[02:29.73] Though it's not a fantasy
[02:32.38] I still want you to stay
[02:44.38] 
[02:36.15] We're just ordinary people
[02:39.95] We don't know which way to go
[02:44.97] â€ Cause we're ordinary people
[02:50.72] Maybe we should take it slow
[03:04.72] 
[02:56.21] Take it slow
[03:19.41] This time we'll take it slow
[03:27.44] Take it slow
[03:32.86] This time we'll take it slow
[03:38.22] Take it slow
[03:44.22] 
[03:55.52] Maybe we'll live and learn
[04:13.43] Maybe we'll crash and burn
[04:14.41] Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave
[04:15.37] Maybe you'll return
[04:24.87] 
[04:17.02] Maybe you'll never find
[04:17.73] Maybe we won't survive
[04:18.53] But maybe we'll grow
[04:19.68] We never know, baby you and I
[04:34.18] 
[04:20.56] We're just ordinary people
[04:21.49] We don't know which way to go, yeah hey
[04:22.24] â€ Cause we're ordinary people
[04:23.29] Maybe we should take it slow, hey hey
[04:41.79] 
[04:23.98] We're just ordinary people
[04:24.58] We don't know which way to go
[04:25.18] â€ Cause we're ordinary people
[04:25.71] Maybe we should take it slow
[04:39.71] 
[04:26.23] Take it slow
[04:26.77] This time we'll take it slow
[04:27.46] Take it slow
[04:27.97] This time we'll take it slow
[04:41.97] 
[04:28.41] Take it slow, slow
[04:28.85] This time we'll take it slow
[04:29.42] Take it slow
[04:29.97] This time we'll take it slow
