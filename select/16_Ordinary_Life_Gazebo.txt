And I she'd my soul, feel it kneeling down...
I'm clutching my faith, pull it tightly round...
You're moving your mouth but you don't make a sound...
But I feel the walls slowly tearing down...
Heel to toe takes you from my side...
In and out, every breath divides...
My eyes to your head,
I can't go the distance...
But when you go you take me in an instant...
In this life, I'll give it time...

It'll be alright, it will be fine...
It's nothing more than ordinary life...
And I show you my sins, show me all your scars...
As we settle in, it's written in the stars...
Your watery eyes got me send me floating...
And my weak heart is swimming with devotion...
But in this life...
I'll give it time...
Cause it's always sneaking up from behind...
It'll be alright, it will be fine...
It's nothing more than ordinary life...
