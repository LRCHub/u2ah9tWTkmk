I dont think Ive ever felt like this
I dont think Ive ever known so much happiness
I never had one touch change so much, and oh what a feeling

This time, Im sure that heaven must have sent you from above
Cause I get butterflies when you whisper sweet love
No other heart will do, oh its only you

Chorus:
You take my breath away, everytime you hold me, I want to say I love you
My cup is to the top, and emotions overflowing
Baby this aint no ordinairy love, this aint no ordinairy love

My love, youve given new meaning to romance and my world
Would never be the same again, no more tears in the rain
No more hidden inhibitions
Its a brand new day and its filled with your magic
We both know that its real and what we feel inside
No mountains too high to climb, no river can divide
After all is said and done youre the one, Im already gone

Chorus

I know nothing is guaranteed, but Ill take my chances
Theres no need to worry, this is not ordinary love

(Instrumental break)

I love you, baby

Baby this aint no ordinairy love, this aint no ordinairy love

Chorus

No ordinary love, aint no, aint no, no ordinary love

No its only you, no other heart will do
Its only you, no other heart will do
Its special, special, its gonna be special, special (to fade)
