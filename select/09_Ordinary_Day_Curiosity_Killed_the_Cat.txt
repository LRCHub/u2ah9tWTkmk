Just keep on baby what you're doing to me
Your being here is solely satisfying
Don't disappear now I don't want you to leave
Then we both forgive and we can both receive
But darling, what is harder to find
If you're not wanting to exert your mind
And say it's just another ordinary day
I want to hear you say
Its just another ordinary day
Oh well, baby now
Mmm, well it's accomplished, when the doing is done
Well, I'll have to say that you were second to none
Feel the spirit, oh feel the need oh, yeah
To stop the come but I think the way you'll agree
But the reward is harder to find
If you're not wanting to exert your mind
You say its just another ordinary day
I want to hear you say
It's Just an Ordinary day
So break it down now
Extraordinary day
I said it's just another ordinary day
Ordinary day
Just another ordinary day
Ex-traor-di-na-ry
What you sacrifice
Sugar and spice and all things nice
Baby maintain you feel so game
When you got me dyin' on an ordinary day
In no ordinary way
See now
(Just another, just another)
Just keep on baby what you're doing, doing to me
In your ordinary way
