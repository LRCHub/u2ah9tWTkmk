You've got a new haircut
New jeans
You're polished to a tee
You say you did it just for me
How unnecessary
I liked you anyway
But now you're lost your brains
Where did my boyfriend go?
I think he's gone insane

I can tell you think you're such a prince
You'll never see
You're ordinary just like me
So ordinary
You could say otherwise
I'll always recognize
You're ordinary just like me
So ordinary

You're walking 'round this town like you're a living dream
I don't care who you think you are honestly
I know some other girls are prettier than me
But you won't see me worry
I won't change a thing
Oh no
I won't change a thing

I can tell you think you're such a prince
You'll never see
You're ordinary just like me
So ordinary
You could say otherwise
I'll always recognize
You're ordinary just like me
So ordinary

I think you've lost your mind
Tight jeans, haircut oh please
You're such a prince but you're no prince
Just ordinary
